# OrbisDbTools

OrbisDbTools is a free cross-platform application for interacting with hacked `PlayStationÂ®4` system databases.  

## Features

* Re-calculate installed application size (fixes absurd game sizes in [this screen](promo/screen4.jpg))
* Re-enable app deletion for user installed apps
* Hide apps that require PSN ([listed here](https://github.com/valters-tomsons/OrbisDbTools/blob/main/src/OrbisDbTools.PS4/KnownContent.cs#L22))
* Rebuild apps missing from database [(internal storage only)](#rebuilding-database-for-extended-storage-apps)

This tool will also automatically backup your `app.db` file to `$TMPDIR/app.db.$TIMESTAMP` when connecting via network. Local database files are backed up in file directory with `.$TIMESTAMP` appended to filename.

### Rebuilding database for extended storage apps

**WARNING:** This is not a safe operation and can damage your drive. I hold no responsibility for any damaged drives on consoles resulting from instructions below.

You can force PS4 to rebuild apps stored on extended storage manually by disconnecting your storage device **without** using the system menu. After re-plugging the drive, accept prompt to repair the storage device. After a few minutes, your titles should start appearing on the home menu.  

## Usage

* Download latest release from `Releases` section for your platform
* Extract downloaded archive into a folder
* Launch `OrbisDbTools.Avalonia` executable
* After patching, upload resulting `app.db` to your PS4 at `/system_data/priv/mms/app.db`
* Launch internet browser on your PS4, then go back to system menu to see your changes
